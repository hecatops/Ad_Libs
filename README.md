# Ad Libs: Real-Time Advertising Analytics
This is an application that uses fabricated data from Faker to stream advertisement analytics to a dashboard. Valuable metrics like RPC, CTR and Peak activities are shown as KPIs with indicators to show an increase or decrease. The app also offers options to switch between dark and light themes. There is a map of Clicks by Region, bar chart of average return on ad spend by type, split between devices and a graph showing conversion and bounce rates. All these metrics can be interpreted to understand all aspects of a marketting campaign and can be used to optimise the results in a client's favour.
